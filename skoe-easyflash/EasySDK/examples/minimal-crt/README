This directory contains files to create a minimal 8k CRT image.

You'll need the acme assembler and the vice emulator installed.

If you have GNU make, just run it. Otherwise you may want to execute the 
commands from Makefile manually.

Vice comes with a tool called cartconv which is able to convert binary files
to crt images and vice versa.

To test the cartridge, run "x64 -cartcrt minimal.crt" or attach it using
"File => Attach a cartridge image => Smart attach CRT Image...".
You can also write it to your EasyFlash.
