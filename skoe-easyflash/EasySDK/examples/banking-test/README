This directory contains files to create a simple but real EasyFlash CRT image.

It contains the standard start-up code which scans the keyboard for "Run/Stop",
"C=" and "Q". If one of these keys is pressed, 

You'll need the acme assembler and the vice emulator installed.

To create the CRT image, the tool bin2efcrt is used. This is invoked with a 
relative path inside EasySDK. Simply make this tool first and then come back
to this example.

If you have GNU make, just run it. Otherwise you may want to execute the 
commands from Makefile manually.

To test the cartridge, run "x64 -cartcrt banking-test.crt" or attach it using
"File => Attach a cartridge image => Smart attach CRT Image...".
You can also write it to your EasyFlash.
