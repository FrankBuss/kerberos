Beginning with version 1.5.0, EasyProg has a fast loader implemented
for 1541, 1571 in 1541 mode, 1581 and sd2iec/uIEC.

The fast loader for sd2iec/uIEC works only with sd2iec/uIEC
firmware 0.10.2 or higher.

If the fast loader does not work with your drive, you can disable
it with "Options" => "Fast loader enabled: No".
