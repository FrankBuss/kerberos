This document describes how to build EasyTransfer from source.

Linux and similar systems
=========================

1. install libwxgtk2.8-dev or whatever name it has on your system. This will
   hopefully also install all other dependencies like libwxbase2.8-dev
   install libftdi-dev and libusb-dev

2. compile it (as normal user) using these commands:

   make

   If you need the command line tool only, you can use:

   make ef3xfer

3. Install it (optional, as root) using this command:

   sudo make install

Step 3 should create a menu entry for Gnome, KDE or Xfce. Note that make
install does not work for ef3xfer only.

Permissions on Linux
--------------------

To access the EasyFlash 3 without being root, on Debian derived systems it
might help to create a new udev rule file:

sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/80-easyflash.rules

add following content:

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="8738", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev"

finally restart the service and re-plug your EasyFlash 3.

sudo restart udev

Do note forget to add your user account to the group plugdev.
Other distributions might work similar.

Windows
=======

To cross compile the software on Linux for Windows, you need following
packages (Debian/Ubuntu naming):
gcc-mingw-w64-i686 g++-mingw-w64-i686 cmake dos2unix


Mac OS X
========

Should work similar as a Linux build.

Other platforms
===============

It may be possible to compile EasyTransfer on other platforms. The most
important precondition is that wxWidgets and libftdi run on that box.

If you get it running somewhere else, I appreciate a report :)
