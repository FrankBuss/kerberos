The EasyFlash's xbank cartridge format is a multibanking cartridge format which
can be placed at any bank in the flash, though all the banks must be continous.
It's similar to the EasyFlash cartridge format.

The magic cartrige id is 33 ($21).

The Game and ExRom configuration in the crt header will be used to determine
which mode should be apply at the startup.

The main difference is that it can be placed on any bank, unlike EasyFlash or
e.g. a Ocean Type 1 cartridges.

The method is really simple: the starting bank will be stored in $df00/$df01,
and the program has to care itself for the addition of the relative bank and
the offset before writing it into the banking register.
