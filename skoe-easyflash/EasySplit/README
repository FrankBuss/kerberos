EasySplit is a program to compress and split files. It is mainly intended to
be used with CRT files (cartridge images), but it may also be useful for
other purposes. Exomizer is used for compression.

File Format
===========

An EasySplit file contains data which is compressed in the same way as
"exoraw -m 4096 -c" does it (exomizer 2 beta), i.e. max offset is 4k,
no literal sequences are used. The compressed data is split into several
files. Each of them has its own header.

When the original file has a CBM-like start address, this is contained in
the encrypted data transparently.
This is the header for an EasySplit file:

typedef struct EasySplitHeader_s
{
    /* PETSCII EASYSPLT (hex 65 61 73 79 73 70 6c 74) */
    char    magic[8];

    /* uncompressed file size (little endian) */
    uint8_t len[4];

    /*
     * CRC-CCITT (start value 0xFFFF) of original file, little endian.
     * When unpacking, you should at least check if all parts contain the
     * same value to make sure not to mix parts of different files.
     */
    uint8_t crc16[2];

    /* Number of this part (0 = "*.01", 1 = "*.02"...) */
    uint8_t part;

    /* Total number of parts */
    uint8_t total;
}
EasySplitHeader;
