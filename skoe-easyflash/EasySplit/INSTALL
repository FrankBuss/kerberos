This document describes how to build EasySplit from source.

Linux and similar systems
=========================

1. install libwxgtk2.8-dev or whatever name it has on your system. This will
   hopefully also install all other dependencies like libwxbase2.8-dev

2. compile it (as normal user) using these commands:

   cd make/gcc-default
   make

3. install it (optional, as root) using this command:

   sudo make install

Step 3 should even create a menu entry for Gnome, KDE or Xfce.

Windows
=======

If you got a binary, just click on it one or two times.

The official release for Windows is built on Linux using a cross compiler
This is done like described in the Linux section above, except that the
Makefile resides in make/win32-cross-mingw. It does also contain a target to
cross-build wxWidgets.

Mac OS X
========

Todo, should work similar as a Linux build.

Other platforms
===============

It may be possible to compile EasySplit on other platforms. The most important
precondition is that wxWidgets runs on that box. You can check it on following
page: http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Supported_Platforms

If you get it running somewhere else, I appreciate a report :)
